  The Kizil Grotto is located in Xinjiang and is the place where numerous cultures from around the world congregated. However, due to various reasons, it has withstood a lot of destruction and has not received the attention similar to that given to other grottos in China such as the Mogao grottoes. In fact, the categorization of the murals according to the time at which it is created is not complete. After the last attempt at classification was done decades, ago, more new Murals have been found.  In light of this, this investigation aims to continue the categorization that had been left off decades ago through the means of a machine learning model. This investigation establishes a machine learning dataset for the Kizil Grotto Murals, introduces a model that is designed specifically for the purpose of classification according to the time period of the Kizil Grotto Murals, and discusses the results that are drawn and its implications.

  Under the instruction of professor Junchi Yan, this paper won the silver prize (2nd place) in the 2022 Rhino–Bird Middle School Science Research Training Program.
